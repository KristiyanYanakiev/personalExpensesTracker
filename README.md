## Overview

This project is a **sandbox for learning Django**. It is **not intended as a production app**, but rather a playground to experiment with different Django concepts, including models, views, forms, **template inheritance**, and more.

## Features Practiced

- Creating and using **models** with various field types and relationships
- Handling **forms** (creation, editing, deletion)
- Implementing **CRUD operations** with function-based views
- Using **class-based views** (optional)
- URL routing and template rendering
- Working with **template inheritance** (base templates and extending)
- Working with `on_delete` behaviors (`PROTECT`, `CASCADE`, `SET_NULL`)
- Basic **user interactions**: GET vs POST requests
- Django admin customization
